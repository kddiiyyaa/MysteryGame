        <br>“Yes, I took the keychain. And no — it wasn’t an accident.
Earlier during lunch, I spilled coffee near the machine. It drew attention, but it also gave me an idea. My own key ring had broken that morning, and I didn’t want to deal with losing my locker keys again.
While people were distracted by the spill and the mess, I stepped away for a moment and went toward the Rec Room. When I saw the silver keychain on the piano, I knew no one was watching closely. The room was busy, and everyone was focused on their own things.
I took it quickly and left before anyone could notice. The small bell made a sound when I picked it up, but no one reacted.
Then I went straight back to the coffee machine and pretended I was cleaning the spill. The wet sleeves, the mess — it made my story believable. If anyone asked, I had a reason to be there the whole time.
I thought the crowd and the distraction would cover everything.
I didn’t expect anyone to connect the coffee stain… or the sound of the bell.”<br><br>
            Your instincts were right all along.<br>
            The keychain has been recovered and the thief has been caught.<br>
            Justice has been served.
