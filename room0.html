                <h3>The Rec Room</h3>
                <p>The Rec Room is meant to be a place of relaxation — soft chatter, scattered laughter, the occasional sound of piano keys filling the air. Comfortable chairs sit in loose circles, books and backpacks rest on tables, and the large piano stands proudly near the windows. But today, something feels different. Beneath the calm atmosphere, there’s tension. Too many glances. Too many half-finished conversations. If something disappeared here, it didn’t vanish quietly — someone made a choice.</p>

                <h3>The Canteen</h3>
                <p>The canteen is loud, chaotic, and alive with movement. The scent of coffee and warm food mixes with the noise of trays clattering and students talking over one another. People move constantly — lining up, sitting down, rushing out. It’s the perfect place to blend in. In a crowd like this, a small action can go completely unnoticed. A quick pocket movement. A faint metallic jingle. A distraction no one thinks twice about.</p>

                <h3>The Restroom</h3>
                <p>The bathroom is brighter but quieter, filled with echoes — running water, footsteps, doors opening and closing. Students come and go quickly, focused on their reflections or washing their hands. No one lingers long. It’s a place for quick fixes — cleaning stains, adjusting appearances, hiding nervous expressions. If someone needed to remove evidence or collect their thoughts, this would be a convenient stop.</p>
