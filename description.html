            <h2>The Missing Keychain</h2>
            <p>At 12:20 PM, during the lunch break, a student entered the Recreation Room and placed their silver keychain on top of the piano while they stepped out briefly. The keychain was easy to recognize — it had engraved initials and a small bell that made a soft ringing sound whenever it was moved. The student returned at 12:40 PM. The keychain was gone. There were no signs of it falling or being misplaced. The piano surface was clear. No one reported turning it in. It had been taken.</p>
            <p>Find out what happened to the keychain and who might have taken it.</p>
